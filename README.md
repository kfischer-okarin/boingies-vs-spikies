# Boingies vs Spikies

Entry for the [KIFASS! Jam](https://itch.io/jam/kifass).

## How to checkout the game

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the contents of the DragonRuby you want to use into the directory (it's all gitignored)

   On Mac/Linux that could be done via:
   ```sh
   cp -R dragonruby-4.10/ boingies-vs-spikies
   ```
   (The slash at the end of the dragonruby directory name is important! otherwise the directory itself will be copied
   instead of its contents)
